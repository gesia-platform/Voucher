### 2. Voucher form

The form of vouchers is largely divided according to the structure and issuance form. Vouchers are divided into consignment and non-consignment depending on the structure of the subject and responsibility. It is classified into the forms of ERC-20 and ERC-1155 according to the issued token type.

In this way, the NFT token issuance method using smart contracts has the following advantages.

| :-------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|        Transparency         | Leveraging the blockchain, information, absorption, and NFT token transactions in all carbon offset certificates can be recorded on the on-chain to confirm the transparency of carbon offset activities in real time. |
|     Guarantee of value      |                                               NFT tokens issued through voucher smart contracts are linked to carbon offset certificates to ensure carbon offset value.                                                |
|      Decentralization       |       Using voucher smart contracts, the issuance and management of carbon offset rights are decentralized by network participants. It hedges centralized risks and establishes an open and transparent system.        |
| Promoting carbon neutrality |         The issued NFT token facilitates carbon neutrality and reduces carbon emissions because individuals or companies involved in carbon offsetting can demonstrate and commercialize their contributions.          |
|    Efficient transaction    |                   The NFT token represents the value corresponding to the carbon offset certificate, so the owner flexibly utilizes the asset through transactions and exchanges with other owners.                    |
