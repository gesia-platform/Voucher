## Voucher

### 1. Issuance of value guarantee tokens through vouchers

In order to on-chain the unique identifier of the carbon voucher that exists as an off-chain and deliver the value, the value of the data of the carbon voucher must be deposited and token issuance based on the value must be made. For this purpose, the following Oracle process is performed.

### 2. Voucher form

The form of vouchers is largely divided according to the structure and issuance form. Vouchers are divided into consignment and non-consignment depending on the structure of the subject and responsibility. It is classified into the forms of ERC-20 and ERC-1155 according to the issued token type.

In this way, the NFT token issuance method using smart contracts has the following advantages.

|        Transparency         | Leveraging the blockchain, information, absorption, and NFT token transactions in all carbon offset certificates can be recorded on the on-chain to confirm the transparency of carbon offset activities in real time. |
|     Guarantee of value      |                                               NFT tokens issued through voucher smart contracts are linked to carbon offset certificates to ensure carbon offset value.                                                |
|      Decentralization       |       Using voucher smart contracts, the issuance and management of carbon offset rights are decentralized by network participants. It hedges centralized risks and establishes an open and transparent system.        |
| Promoting carbon neutrality |         The issued NFT token facilitates carbon neutrality and reduces carbon emissions because individuals or companies involved in carbon offsetting can demonstrate and commercialize their contributions.          |
|    Efficient transaction    |                   The NFT token represents the value corresponding to the carbon offset certificate, so the owner flexibly utilizes the asset through transactions and exchanges with other owners.                    |
